    <p class='c-static-card-title'>Games can be broadly classified into the following two categories:</p>
    <p class='c-static-card-content'>Games by chance are considered where the winner is ascertained merely by luck and the result is contingent and a person cannot apply his/her mind or or his/her efforts to determine/ influence the result . Generally, such games are considered as illegal as it constitutes as gambling.</p>
   
    <p class='c-static-card-content'>Games by skill are where users skill play the important role in determining the results. Here result depends primarily upon the knowledge, training, attention, experience of the users. Hence, such games are not deemed to constitute gambling and do not contravenes of the laws prohibiting gambling.</p>
   
    <p class='c-static-card-content'>Under the game of skill as per Indian law, skill must predominate the element of chance in determining/ascertaining the results of the game/ Leagues/ Contest. Thus, the extent to which skill is involved in the game is the key factor in the determination of the nature and legality of the game under Indian law.</p>
  
    <p class='c-static-card-content'>Accordingly, games such as Rummy, Chess, Carrom and Wagering on Horse Races have been recognised as games of skill by the courts in India.</p>

    <div>
    
    <p class='c-static-card-content'>The principal legislation governing gambling in India is the Public Gambling Act, 1867 (“PGA”). The PGA criminalises the act of ‘gambling’ in a public forum and the keeping of a ‘common gaming house’. The PGA, however, creates an important exception in favour of games of skill, by stating that the provisions of the PGA shall [not] be held to apply to any ‘game of mere skill’ wherever played.</p>

    
    <p class='c-static-card-content'>In determining whether a given game or contest is a game of skill or chance, Indian courts have adopted the standard of assessing the ‘dominant factor’ of a game. The two most important Indian cases in this regard are State of Andhra Pradesh v. K Satyanarayana (AIR 1968 SC 825) (the “Satyanarayana” case) and KR Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu (AIR 1996 SC 1153) (the “Lakshmanan” case).</p>

    
    <p class='c-static-card-content'>In the Satyanarayana case, the Supreme Court defined a ‘game of mere skill’ to mean a game “in which, although the element of chance necessarily cannot be entirely eliminated, success depends principally upon the superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and adroitness of the player.” By application of this definition, the Supreme Court held that the game of rummy was a game of skill, and did not amount to gambling under the PGA. While upholding the levy of a nominal service charge for provision of a physical space, cards, etc., to play a game of rummy, the Court reasoned:</p>

    
    <p class='c-static-card-content'>Rummy...... requires certain amount of skill because the fall of the cards has to be memorised and the building up of Rummy requires considerable skill in holding and discarding cards. We cannot, therefore, say that the game of Rummy is a game of entire chance. It is mainly and preponderantly a game of skill.</p>


    <p class='c-static-card-content'>In the Lakshmanan case, the Supreme Court held that the betting on horse races was a game of skill. It rationalised that in a horse race the winner is not determined by chance alone, as the condition, speed and endurance of the horse and the skill and management of the rider are factors affecting the result of the race. The bettor has the opportunity to exercise his judgment and discretion in determining the horse on which to bet.
